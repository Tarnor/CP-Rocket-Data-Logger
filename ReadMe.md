This code was written to log accelerometer data on an Adafruit CircuitPlayground Express
It uses both buttons for control and the switch to allow writing to the filesystem.
It is my first attempt at coding in CircuitPython and my first use of Adafruit hardware.
I have yet to calibrate the accelerometers and test them in a rocket.
